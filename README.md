# Skill Track: Statistics Fundamentals with Python

Statistical knowledge is key to evaluating, interpreting, and reporting findings from your data. With these courses, you will learn to confidently evaluate statistical models, simulate data, and draw conclusions from a wide variety of data sets.

It consists of 5 courses: 

1. Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)
2. Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)
3. Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python
4. Statistical Simulation in Python
5. Case Studies in Statistical Thinking

## 1. Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)

### A. Course Description

After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

## 2. Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)

### A. Course Description

After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

## 3. Introduction To Linear Modeling in Python:

### A. Course Description

One of the primary goals of any scientist is to find patterns in data and build models to describe, predict, and extract insight from those patterns.
The most fundamental of these patterns is a linear relationship between two variables.
This course provides an introduction to exploring, quantifying, and modeling linear relationships in data, by demonstrating techniques such as least-squares, linear regression, estimatation, and bootstrap resampling.
Here you will apply the most powerful modeling tools in the python data science ecosystem, including scipy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, to build and evaluate linear models.
By exploring the concepts and applications of linear models with python, this course serves as both a practical introduction to modeling, and as a foundation for learning more advanced modeling techniques and tools in statistics and machine learning.

## 4. Case Studies in Statistical Thinking:

### A. Course Description

Mastery requires practice. Having completed Statistical Thinking I and II, you developed your probabilistic mindset and the hacker stats skills to extract actionable insights from your data. Your foundation is in place, and now it is time practice your craft. In this course, you will apply your statistical thinking skills, exploratory data analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, to two new real-world data sets. First, you will explore data from the 2013 and 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships, where you will quantify the relative speeds and variability among swimmers. You will then perform a statistical analysis to assess the "current controversy" of the 2013 Worlds in which swimmers claimed that a slight current in the pool was affecting result. Second, you will study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes around the world. Finally, you will analyze the changes in seismicity in the US state of Oklahoma after the practice of high pressure waste water injection at oil extraction sites became commonplace in the last decade. As you work with these data sets, you will take vital steps toward mastery as you cement your existing knowledge and broaden your abilities to use statistics and Python to make sense of your data.

## 5. Statistical Simulation in Python:

### A. Course Description

Simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use the relatively simple idea of random sampling to solve increasingly complex problems. Although they have been around for ages, they have gained in popularity recently due to the rise in computational power and have seen applications in multiple domains including Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Computational Biology and Finance just to name a few. Students will use simulations to generate and analyze data over different probability distributions using the important NumPy package. This course will give students hands-on experience with simulations using simple, real-world applications.
